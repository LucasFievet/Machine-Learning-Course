Description
"We didn't use any preprocessing techniques to achieve our score. For each brain scan we flattened the 3D array to a vector and created a histogram with 12 bins evenly spaced between the intensity values 10 and 2000.
We then use a logistic classifier with a robust probability prediction to minimize the log-loss while using 4-fold CV to estimate the mean and variance of the log-loss."
